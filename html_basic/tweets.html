<h1>The world of coding is an amazing space</h1>
<p> From ancient times, there has always been a quest to provide a global and easy means of communication</p>
<h2>Tools needed for coding</h2>
<p>Intrestingly, there are a lot of tools to explore, the visual studio code which is a text editor, the git and github to mention a few</p>
<h3> The right attitude towards coding</h3>
<p>A lazy man cannot excel in coding, an intrisic drive for excellence and the quest to do hard things is a basic requirement</p>
<p>ALX has made learning coding easy, the tutorials, live learning sessions are amazingly commendable</p>
<p>Coding is an enjoyable task.</p>
